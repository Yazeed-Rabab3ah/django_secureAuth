# 🔐 Secure User Management Web Application


A simple yet secure web application built with **Django**, **HTML**, and **Bootstrap CSS**, featuring **user authentication with OTP-based two-factor authentication (2FA)**.
I use this Project as a reference when I want to create a new django project.
It's may include unnessesry things, but I'm lazy to remove 


## ✨ Features

* **User Authentication**

  * Registration, login, and logout
  * OTP-based **two-factor authentication (2FA)** using time-based one-time passwords

* **Security Controls**

  * ✅ Input validation & sanitization (prevent XSS & SQL injection)
  * ✅ CSRF protection using Django’s built-in middleware
  * ✅ Passwords hashed before storage(built-in)

## 🔑 OTP Two-Factor Authentication

* On login, users receive an OTP generated by **PyOTP**.
* OTPs are time-based and expire after a short interval.
* The second authentication step ensures account security even if the password is compromised.
